### Development Environment Setup

#### MacOS

1. Install Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

2. Install Node Version Manager using Homebrew: `brew install nvm`

3. Install Git using Homebrew: `brew install git`

4. Install PlanetScaleCLI using Homebrew: `brew install planetscale/tap/pscale`

5. Install the MySQL command line client: `brew install mysql-client`

6. Install latest LTS version of Node.js: `nvm install --lts`

7. Confirm node installation using `node -v`

8. Enable corepack for Node.js: `corepack enable pnpm`

9. Install PNPM using corepack: `corepack use pnpm@latest`

10. Clone the repository

    - SSH (Recommended): `git clone git@github.com:EquippedTeam/equipped.git`
        - For help setting up ssh, see [the github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
    - HTTPS (deprecated): `git clone https://github.com/EquippedTeam/equipped.git`

11. Install dependencies using PNPM: `pnpm install`

12. Start Dev Servers and start coding!

    - If you use VS Code, dev servers will run automatically on http://localhost:5173 and http://localhost:3000

        - Port 5173 is the standard dev server for SvelteKit

        - Port 3000 is a special dev server using vercel, which simulates more closely how it will look on our Vercel Edge config. This is the server used for tests, so if you are troubleshooting a failing test, use this one.

    - For other IDE's, you can use pnpm scripts to start the dev servers

        - Standard Dev Server: `pnpm dev`
        - Vercel Dev Server: `pnpm vercel-dev`

#### Windows

1. Open a powershell terminal and install Scoop

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

    ```

2. Install Git for Windows from [their downloads page](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

3. Install Node Version Manager using Scoop

    ```powershell
    scoop bucket add main
