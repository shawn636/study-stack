3. Install Git using Homebrew: `brew install git`

4. Install PlanetScaleCLI using Homebrew: `brew install planetscale/tap/pscale`

5. Install JQ using Homebrew: `brew instal jq`

6. Install the MySQL command line client: `brew install mysql-client`

7. Install GitHub CLI via Homebrew: `brew install gh`

8. Install latest LTS version of Node.js: `nvm install --lts`

9. Confirm node installation using `node -v`

10. Enable corepack for Node.js: `corepack enable pnpm`

11. Install PNPM using corepack: `corepack use pnpm@latest`

12. Clone the repository

    - SSH (Recommended): `git clone git@github.com:EquippedTeam/equipped.git`
        - For help setting up ssh, see [the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
    - HTTPS (deprecated): `git clone https://github.com/EquippedTeam/equipped.git`

13. Install dependencies using PNPM: `pnpm install`

14. Set Zsh as the default terminal in VS Code

    - On your VsCode in Mac : `shift + command + P` .
    - On the Prompt > type : `Terminal: Select Default Profile` , then "Click it". Note, as you type you will find this option in the auto-complete.
    - Click the option for zsh or your desired shell.
    - Restart VSCode .

15. Start Dev Servers and start coding!

    - If you use VS Code, dev servers will run automatically on http://localhost:5173 and http://localhost:3000

        - Port 5173 is the standard dev server for SvelteKit

        - Port 3000 is a special dev server using vercel, which simulates more closely how it will look on our Vercel Edge config. This is the server used for tests, so if you are troubleshooting a failing test, use this one.

    - For other IDE's, you can use pnpm scripts to start the dev servers

        - Standard Dev Server: `pnpm dev`
        - Vercel Dev Server: `pnpm vercel-dev`
